lorenz-attractor
================

An interactive web based demonstration of the Lorenz chaotic attractor.

You need to install the flot jquery graphing plugin under 'flot/' for this code to work. See: http://www.flotcharts.org/ . You also need to install jquery-ui to 'jquery-ui/'. See: http://jqueryui.com/

Having done this, you just need to copy to a directory inside your web root, and set the file permissions right for your system.

There is an online demo of the program working at: http://highfellow.github.com/lorenz-attractor/attractor.html.

See LICENSE for Licensing. Roughly you can do what you like with it as long as you credit me and don't expect it to work for any serious purpose.
